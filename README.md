# SparkR-meetup
Code that was shown on the R belgium meetup (october 21, 2015) about SparkR

demo_1.1 and demo_1.2 are introductionary to the SparkR API, demo_2.1 and demo_2.6 are more focussed on R integration and our own machine learning algorithms.
You will notice that demo_2.2 until demo_2.5 are missing. This is due to the fact that this is the InfofarmSparkML code, which is provided in another branch.
All example code should work with Spark-1.5.1
